# wasdeparser

`wasdeparser` is a Python package that facilitates access to and use of data from the [USDA](https://www.usda.gov/) World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates.

# Motivation

The USDA makes their data [freely available online](https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/3t945q76s?locale=en&page=13#release-items), but the format in which those data are promulgated does not lend itself to easy between-year analysis or multi-year display. This package is intended to streamline the acquisition and 'cleaning' of multiple years' worth of data, outputting them in a format more suitable for analysis and display. 

# Features

* Download and clean multiple years of WASDE data with a single line of code
* Choose which variables to extract
* Create analysis-ready Excel or CSV files
